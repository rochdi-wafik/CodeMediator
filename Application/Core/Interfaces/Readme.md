# Core Organization
- Interfaces are like references to the core classes.
- Interface draw the path of the core classes that needs to follow.
- This will make the framework more flexible, organizable, and debug-able.

- Interfaces serve as references to core classes, 
  defining the structure and behavior they must follow.
- Interfaces outline the path that core classes must take, 
  making the framework more flexible, organized, and debuggable.

# Methods Documentation
- Instead of digging into the class that contains the method logic, 
  users can visit the interface for method documentation.
- Interfaces provide a clear and concise definition of each method, 
  making it easier for users to understand how to use them.

# Explore Methods
- When users want to explore the methods of a class, they can visit the interface
  instead of navigating through the class that contains the boilerplate logic.
