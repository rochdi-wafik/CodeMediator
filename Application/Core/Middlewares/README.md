# Core MiddleWares
- These middlewares are auto-loaded by the Router.
- These middlewares are a part of the core framework, They should not be modified or removed.

* Removing these middlewares might not immediately break your application, but it could significantly impact its security, performance, or overall functionality.
*  Each middleware plays a specific role in ensuring the application's stability and security.  Altering them could introduce unintended consequences.
*  If you need to customize behavior, consider creating your own middlewares instead of modifying the core ones.  Extend the framework's functionality rather than altering its core components.

For more information on the individual roles of each middleware, please refer to the framework's documentation.
