# CodeMediator - Your Friendly PHP Framework

CodeMediator is a PHP framework designed to make building web applications easier and faster. Think of it as your helpful coding buddy that takes care of the tricky stuff so you can focus on bringing your amazing ideas to life!

## What's So Great About CodeMediator?

CodeMediator comes packed with cool features to help you build secure and efficient web apps:

* **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:** We use the MVC pattern to keep your code organized and easy to manage. It's like having separate rooms for different parts of your application, making everything cleaner!
* **Built-in Helpers and Libraries:** We've included a bunch of ready-to-use tools (libraries and helpers) and functions that will save you tons of time. No need to write everything from scratch!
* **Security First:** We take security seriously! CodeMediator helps protect your applications from common web threats like:
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Prevents bad guys from injecting harmful code into your website.
    * **Session Hijacking:** Keeps user sessions safe and secure.
    * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Protects against unauthorized actions on behalf of users.
* **Middlewares:** Think of middlewares as gatekeepers for your application. They allow you to run code before or after requests, which is super useful for things like checking if a user is logged in.
* **Smart Routing:** We have a built-in system to handle how your website responds to different URLs. You can use our default routing system or create your own custom routes to make your website's addresses look exactly how you want them.
* **Caching System:** Make your website load faster! Our caching system stores frequently accessed data so it doesn't have to be generated every time.
* **Easy Database Interaction:** Working with databases is a breeze with our built-in functions and APIs. You can perform database operations securely with less code.
* **Configuration Made Simple:** Our `config` file lets you easily set up your web application. Examples:
    * Define your website's main address (`base_url`). (Don't worry, we'll try to guess it for you!)
    * Set up a proxy if you're using one for local development.
    * Choose your timezone.
    * Set a default page that loads first and a fallback "Oops, page not found!" page (for 404 errors).
    * Switch between development mode (for debugging) and production mode (for your live website).
    * And much more!
* **Composer Support:** You can easily add and manage external libraries to your CodeMediator project using Composer, the popular PHP dependency manager.
* **Clean Structure:** We've organized everything in a way that's easy to understand and navigate.
